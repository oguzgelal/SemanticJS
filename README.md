SemanticJS
=====
This is *(will be)* an open-source javascript library for building **Semantic Web** and **Linked Data** applications. This will be similar to <a href='http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/' target='_new'>OWL API</a> and <a href='https://jena.apache.org/' target='_new'>Jena API</a>. You will be able to create Ontologies, visually list the Ontologies and *(hopefully)* run the **reasoner** to fully get the benefit of the semantic web technology.

This is pretty new, this README will be updated with new informations. For now, you can contact me from <a href='http://oguzgelal.com/contact' target='_new'>oguzgelal.com/contact</a>.
